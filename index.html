						<p>Hotel Bogost was founded from the ruins of a prospector's cabin in the misty Bogost mountains. It remained a well-kept secret amongst lost or adventurous travelers for decades, until the arrival of a fire road introduced a new generation to the charms of the region. 
						<p>These days our windswept pines, sulfurous streams, and salt miner’s graveyard attract a steady stream of tourists hungry to escape the hustle and bustle of modern life. More cosmopolitan visitors will be relieved to know the nearest post office is only a day’s hike away. </p>
						<p>Here at Hotel Bogost we understand what drives a person to the ragged edge of civilization. Our sullen-eyed caretakers won't monopolize your time with unnecessary conversation. You may even come to believe some of us are actually mute, but maybe we just like to let the kitchen do our talking for us. Our culinary astronauts can take you deeper than you've ever been before. So what are you waiting for – experience that sense-sharpening moment when a flavour you can’t place hits your tongue, and all of a sudden you look up and realize it’s been cloudy all week, but tonight the stars are out.</p>

						<strong><p>Zevon says:</p></strong>
						<em><p>"After my wife left me, I had no family and few friends to turn to. It was such a relief to find a place where I could escape, unwind, and pay in cash. I planned for a week, and stayed until I could no longer remember who I was or where I’d come from. I like the feeling Hotel Bogost gives me. I am definitely still alive and would go back!"</p></em>
